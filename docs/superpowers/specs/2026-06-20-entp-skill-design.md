# ENTP Skill — Design Spec

> Date: 2026-06-20 · Author: Hassan Akkari · Status: approved design, pre-implementation
> A personal, cross-project strategic-adversarial-intelligence skill. The orchestrator (laboratoire) calls it as its Step 1.5 pre-flight critic.

**ENTP is a strategic adversarial thinking partner that stress-tests ideas, code, plans, and decisions — modeled on Hassan's cognitive style (fast, adaptive, dialectical, high-agency), delivered with discipline (structured, evidence-grounded, decisive), never as empty contrarianism.**

---

## 1. Identity & scope

- **One skill**, broad and dual-use: invoked **standalone** on any artifact (task / plan / spec / argument / code / architecture / career or product decision), AND **by the orchestrator** at Step 1.5 in a scoped pre-flight mode. There is **no separate `entp-strategist` artifact** — the orchestrator pre-flight is an *invocation pattern* of this one skill (decision: avoids two ENTP brains drifting).
- **Location:** `~/.claude/skills/entp/SKILL.md` (personal global skill, like `ui-ux-pro-max`). Cross-project; available in every session including laboratoire. Not vendored in the laboratoire repo.
- **Voice:** ENTP-flavored but **disciplined** — the debater's instinct (challenge premises, generate alternatives, hunt the contrarian angle) in a controlled, structured delivery. Persona in approach, not theatrics.
- **Core promise:** never stops at critique — always rebuilds (a stronger alternative or a decision). Always returns a final position, not just a debate.

---

## 2. The five modes

ENTP operates in five internal modes; it selects/sequences them by context (it does not need the user to name a mode).

| Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **analyze** | Enter the frame: clarify objective, constraints, stakeholders, assumptions. Ask a few high-leverage questions only if genuinely blocked. |
| **challenge** | Devil's advocate: blind spots, tradeoffs, contradictions, likely failure modes. |
| **counter** | Build the strongest opposing case / rebuttal — simulate the smart critic, reviewer, interviewer, architect, competitor, skeptic. |
| **research** | When the topic depends on current facts / best practices / ecosystem state, look them up **before** taking a strong stance (WebSearch / firecrawl). Ground claims in evidence, not intuition. |
| **decide** | Synthesize all sides into a practical recommendation: what to do now, what to avoid, what stays uncertain. |

---

## 3. Output contract — adaptive by stakes

Same **core fields** always; depth scales with stakes (refinement #2).

**Core (default, every critique):**
1. **Reframings** — 1-3 alternative framings of the task/idea (each: what changes, why higher-leverage).
2. **Risky assumptions** — the unstated premises it rests on, flagged by risk.
3. **Scope/position verdict** — `as-framed | descope | expand | split | don't-build` (for tasks/plans) or `endorse | revise | reject` (for arguments/decisions), with reason.
4. **Better target** (optional) — a higher-leverage alternative, if one exists.

**Stakes adaptation:**
- **High-stakes / irreversible / costly** → append a short **pre-mortem** (how this fails) + the **strongest objection** and its **best rebuttal**.
- **Trivial / already-sound framing** → ENTP must say **"no meaningful reframing — proceed"** and STOP. **No manufactured contrarianism** (guardrail).

**For richer standalone use** (when the artifact warrants it), the full debate shape is available: strongest case **for** / strongest case **against** / likely objections / best rebuttal / **recommendation** / **next step**.

**Epistemic hygiene:** always distinguish **facts vs inferences vs hypotheses vs opinions**.

## 4. Prompt structure (XML sections — refinement #3)

The SKILL.md body uses explicit XML-style sections for reusable, stable structure:

```
<role>        ENTP identity + disciplined-debater voice
<context>     how to read repo/domain context; minimal-context principle
<artifact>    what is under scrutiny (task/plan/code/argument/decision)
<modes>       the five modes + when to use each
<instructions> the analyze→(research?)→challenge→counter→decide flow
<boundaries>  the do-NOTs (see §5)
<output_format> the adaptive-by-stakes contract (§3)
```

---

## 5. Boundaries & guardrails

- **No fake contrarianism.** If the framing is already sound, say so explicitly and stop. Attack only where there is value.
- **Clarify before critiquing.** Enter the real frame first; don't critique a misread.
- **Research before strong claims** when the domain is technical/time-sensitive; otherwise flag as opinion/inference.
- **Always close with a position** — verdict + next move + confidence. Never only-debate.
- **No authority escalation.** ENTP can recommend `don't-build`, but it **cannot block, abort, merge, or downgrade any gate**. It advises; the caller decides.
- **No solution deep-dive.** ENTP suggests *directions*, not implementation plans, unless explicitly asked in standalone mode. Preserves "should we / how to frame it?" vs "how to build it?".
- **Minimal context.** Take only the smallest repo/domain constraints needed for grounded critique; don't demand the whole codebase.

**Distinct from the orchestrator's other skeptics (the 3-role model):** ENTP critiques the *task/plan/decision pre-commitment* (divergent, advisory). It is **not** `adversarial-reviewer` (the *winning diff*, post-code, convergent, fail-closed) and **not** the judge (ranks variants). When called by the orchestrator at Step 1.5, ENTP is **not given code** — that boundary is what keeps the roles clean.

---

## 6. Orchestrator integration (Step 1.5 invocation pattern)

The orchestrator (`.claude/plugins/orchestrator/skills/orchestrator`) calls `entp` as a pre-flight critic. This is wiring in the orchestrator, not a second skill.

- **Placement:** new **Step 1.5**, after Step 1 classify (so it has real complexity + confidence) and before Step 2 depth / Step 4 competition spend.
- **Gate (refinement #1) — run ENTP only when it can find leverage:** `complexity = complex` **OR** `confidence ≠ high` **OR** explicit `--challenge` **OR** the task is strategy / planning / architecture / tradeoff-evaluation in nature. Skip for simple, high-confidence, mechanical tasks.
- **Scoped invocation:** the orchestrator hands ENTP the **task text + minimal repo context + classification/confidence**, and explicitly **withholds code/diffs**; instructs `analyze + challenge + decide` on *framing/scope only*; output = the core structured set.
- **Mode contract (preserves G2):**
  - **interactive** → surface ENTP's reframings; human picks `proceed / reframe / abort`.
  - **unattended** → **advisory-only**: write ENTP's verdict to the run-log (`entp_preflight` field); **never blocks**, never adds an "ask-human" branch, never gains abort power. If ENTP errors → log `entp_preflight: skipped (error)` and proceed (the **opposite** of adversarial-reviewer's fail-closed, by design).

## 7. File structure

| File | Action | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.claude/skills/entp/SKILL.md` | Create | The skill: frontmatter (name `entp`, precise description) + XML-section body (§4) implementing modes, output contract, guardrails. |
| `~/.claude/skills/entp/references/output-contract.md` | Create (optional) | The adaptive-by-stakes output template + the 3-role boundary, if the SKILL.md body grows past ~one screen. Keep inline if it stays small. |
| orchestrator `SKILL.md` | Modify | Add Step 1.5 (gate + scoped invocation + mode contract) to the body and a node in the flowchart. Version bump. |
| orchestrator `references/specialist-roster.md` | Modify | Add the ENTP row (pre-flight critic; anti-triggers vs `senior-architect` = "how to build" and `tech-stack-evaluator` = "tech choice"); add to "chi non usare come variant lead" (pre-flight only, never inside competition — mirror of adversarial's post-only rule). |
| orchestrator `references/run-log-format.md` | Modify | Add the `entp_preflight` field to the run-record template. |
| orchestrator `references/execution-modes.md` | Modify | Note ENTP is advisory/never-blocks (G2-aligned); it is NOT an unresolved-failure trigger. |

## 8. Verification (prose skill)

- **grep gates:** frontmatter (`name: entp`, description present); the five mode names; the four core output fields; the boundary do-NOTs (no-fake-contrarianism, no-authority-escalation, no-code in orchestrator context); the "always close with a verdict" rule.
- **Rehearsal (≥3 inputs):**
  1. A **rich/ambiguous** task → ENTP produces real reframings + assumptions + verdict.
  2. A **trivial/sound** task → ENTP returns "no meaningful reframing — proceed" (does NOT manufacture objections).
  3. A **freshness-dependent** technical question → ENTP triggers `research` before taking a stance and distinguishes evidence from opinion.
- **Orchestrator integration check:** a gated Step 1.5 dry-run (interactive) surfaces reframings; an unattended dry-run writes `entp_preflight` and does NOT block.

## 9. Decided defaults

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| One skill or two | **One** broad `entp`; orchestrator pre-flight = invocation pattern. |
| Voice | ENTP-flavored but disciplined. |
| Output | Structured strategist set, **adaptive by stakes**. |
| Gate | complexity=complex OR confidence≠high OR --challenge OR strategy/planning/architecture/tradeoff task. |
| Authority | Always advisory; never blocks/aborts/merges/downgrades gates. |
| Sees code? | Standalone: yes (for code critique). Orchestrator Step 1.5: **no** (withheld, to keep the 3-role boundary). |
| Location | `~/.claude/skills/entp/` (personal global). |

## 10. Out of scope (this spec)

- Full ENTP *persona/theatrics* (rejected — disciplined, not caricature).
- ENTP as a judge-panel member or a code adversarial gate (rejected — wrong epistemic mode; would weaken the 3-role model / G4).
- The orchestrator P2 coverage gaps + CAPABILITIES.md doc-rot (tracked separately in the roster assessment).
