# Follow-up — observations collected outside this PR's scope

> Created during `chore: deploy topology cleanup` (branch `chore/deploy-topology-cleanup`). Smells noted but **not** fixed here, per the brief's "no scope creep" rule. Each entry has enough evidence and a suggested next step.

## Open decision points (asked back to the human)

| ID | Topic | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **D1** | Fate of `apps/web-next` (WIP / smoke-test / abandoned) | **Answered 2026-05-07**: WIP framework-showcase prototype. Will eventually be linked from the portfolio (route/subdomain/external — TBD). No urgency. |
| **D2** | OVH topology — what runs there, service type, deploy mechanism | **Answered 2026-05-07**: OVH is registrar/DNS only for the portfolio domain — points at Vercel. **No OVH compute in scope.** Original premise of "OVH as deploy target for web-react/web-next" was wrong; corrected in CLAUDE.md. |
| **D3** | Values for the `<DATE>` and `<ISSUE>` placeholders in the new MVP guard comments | **Resolved 2026-05-07**: no issue tracker / no deadline. Placeholders removed; comment reads `MVP-ONLY — replace before going live with real users`. |

D1/D2 closed. P2 (`apps/web-next` build-only path) is no longer blocked — but also no longer urgent, since web-next has no production target. Defer until hosting strategy is decided.

## Doc / repo cleanup pairs left dangling

These are direct consequences of work in this PR. Resolve in a small follow-up so the codebase stays coherent.

### F1 — `README.md` still references the deleted GH Pages workflow ✅ RESOLVED 2026-05-07

- **Was**: `README.md` "Deploy GitHub Pages" section referencing `deploy-user-site.yml`, `GH_PAGES_TOKEN`, target external repo.
- **Fix applied**: section rewritten to describe the actual topology (Vercel for `docs`, OVH for DNS only, no deploy for `web-react`/`web-next`). "Stato attuale" block also updated.

### F2 — `apps/web-react/vite.config.ts` dead `@laboratoire/ui` alias ✅ RESOLVED 2026-05-07

- **Was**: build-time alias resolving `@laboratoire/ui` to `packages/ui/src` or `packages/ui/dist/index.js`, plus the `existsSync` guard, despite `web-react` never importing the package.
- **Fix applied**: `apps/web-react/vite.config.ts` simplified — removed the alias block, the source/dist toggle, the existsSync guard, the unused `loadEnv`/`existsSync`/`path` imports, and the dangling `// const isPages = …` comment. Kept `base: "/react/"`, the React plugin, and the Tailwind PostCSS plugin.

### F3 — `_bootstrap-report.md` is a frozen snapshot mentioning the removed workflow

- **Where**: `.claude/_bootstrap-report.md:11` lists `deploy-user-site.yml` among inspected configs.
- **Why not fixed**: it's an analysis trail / point-in-time artifact. Updating it would falsify history.
- **Suggested approach**: leave as-is. If / when the next bootstrap pass runs, it will produce a fresh snapshot.

---

## Latent smells noticed but out of scope

### F4 — `apps/web-react` has no `tailwind.config.ts`

- **Where**: `apps/web-react/` (compare to `apps/docs/tailwind.config.ts`).
- **Behavior**: Tailwind v4's postcss plugin still runs, but content scanning is implicit and may miss class usage. Already noted in `CLAUDE.md` Gotcha #3 (originally Gotcha #3 pre-cleanup).
- **Suggested fix**: either add an explicit config file mirroring `apps/docs/tailwind.config.ts`, or drop Tailwind from web-react if not actively used. Decide as part of the broader web-react audit.

### F5 — Three Tailwind setups with drifting design tokens

- **Where**: `apps/docs/src/index.css:14-49`, `apps/web-react/src/index.css:14-33`, `apps/web-next/app/globals.css`.
- **Behavior**: dark/light token values diverge across apps. Already noted in `CLAUDE.md` Gotchas (now #3).
- **Suggested fix**: consolidate canonical tokens in `packages/ui` (CSS variables exposed via a `theme.css` exported from the package) and have each app import them. Bigger refactor; needs design alignment.

### F6 — Free-form commit-message convention, no linter

- **Where**: history mixes `feat:`/`fix:`/`chore:` with one-word commits like `gg`, `sb`, `last updates`.
- **Behavior**: no enforcement. Already documented in `CLAUDE.md` Conventions.
- **Suggested fix**: add `commitlint` + `husky` if semantic versioning becomes a goal. Otherwise leave it.

### F7 — `pnpm` 11.0.8 is available; lockfile pinned to 10.0.0

- **Where**: install output during P0.1 surfaced an upgrade banner. `package.json#packageManager` and `.node-version` still target 10.x.
- **Suggested fix**: planned bump in a separate PR — coordinate with all devs on the team since `packageManager` is enforced.

### F8 — No pre-commit hooks (lint/typecheck/test)

- **Where**: no `.husky/`, no `lint-staged` config.
- **Behavior**: `pnpm check` only runs in CI (or when a human remembers locally).
- **Suggested fix**: small `husky` + `lint-staged` setup that runs `eslint --fix` and `tsc --noEmit` on changed files. Won't catch tests but covers most regressions.

### F9 — Zero React-component tests

- **Where**: every test under `apps/*` and `packages/ui` is a Zod-schema or pure-function test. No `@testing-library/react`, no Playwright.
- **Suggested fix**: introduce RTL for the `apps/web-next/app/checkout/` flow first (where the real risk lives — payment + idempotency). Pair with the booking-engine-author agent in `AGENTS.md`.

### F10 — Two SPA `index.html → 404.html` copy variants (legacy from GH Pages)

- **Where**: `apps/docs/package.json:8` (inline) and `apps/web-react/package.json:9-10` (postbuild hook).
- **Behavior**: vestigial — Vercel handles SPA routing natively. Harmless but pointless.
- **Suggested fix**: remove both copy steps once it's confirmed nothing relies on `404.html` for SPA fallback in the new topology. Trivial diff.

### F11 — Deprecated `baseUrl` in `apps/docs/tsconfig.app.json` ✅ RESOLVED 2026-05-08

- **Was**: `apps/docs/tsconfig.app.json:10` — `"baseUrl": "."`. TS 5.x emitted `Option 'baseUrl' is deprecated and will stop functioning in TypeScript 7.0`.
- **Fix applied**: dropped the `baseUrl` line. The single `paths` entry is now resolved relative to the tsconfig file (default behaviour since TS 5.x). Verified `@laboratoire/ui` import still resolves at type-check (Vite alias in `apps/docs/vite.config.ts:25-27` already handles runtime resolution independently).

### F12 — Personal admin/booking page (manage availability + appointments) — DIRECTION DECIDED 2026-05-08

- **Where**: net-new feature. Hybrid layout: Cal.com handles booking infra; a thin custom surface inside `apps/docs` (or a new `/admin` route gated by auth) handles whatever Cal.com doesn't cover.
- **What's needed**: (1) bookable calendar with Hassan's availability windows, (2) incoming-call inbox visible to Hassan, (3) optional dashboard for lead-source attribution + quick actions, (4) maybe a status pill on the public hero ("disponibile / in slot pieni").
- **Decision**: hybrid with Cal.com Free tier. Free tier covers everything needed for a solo freelancer:
  - 1 user, unlimited event types and calendars
  - Email + SMS notifications, 100+ integrations (Google/Outlook Calendar, Slack)
  - Stripe + PayPal payment acceptance (future-proof for paid intro calls)
  - Webhooks (the hook for any custom logic on booking events)
  - 1-click Calendly import (easy migration if a Calendly account already exists)
- **Concrete plan when this gets built**:
  1. Create a Cal.com event type for "Free 20-min intro call" + one for "Audit follow-up" (post-audit upsell flow).
  2. Embed the Cal.com inline widget on the `/audit` follow-up step ("Vuoi una call dopo aver letto il report?") and as a third option in `FinalCTASection` next to WhatsApp + email.
  3. Wire a Cal.com webhook to a Vercel Function in `apps/web-next` (or a new `apps/admin` if scope grows) that (a) logs booking events to a persistent store, (b) optionally pings Hassan via Slack/Telegram, (c) updates a lightweight "current slot status" feed the public hero can read.
  4. Build the admin dashboard (auth-gated) only when Cal.com's own admin UI proves insufficient — likely never for phase 1.
- **Dependencies for the custom side**: persistent store (replace MVP-only `globalThis.__bookingOrderStore__`), real auth (replace MVP-only cookie session). Both already flagged as MVP guards in web-next; neither is urgent until inbound flow is real.
- **Why still deferred**: the conversion-pitch sprint must ship first. Cal.com itself can be set up in 30 min independently — the integration into the site (embed + webhook) is the real work.

### F13 — Tailwind v4 canonical CSS variable syntax sweep

- **Where**: 79 occurrences of `[var(--app-*)]` across 11 files in `apps/docs/src/` (HeroSection, AuditPage, ServicesSection, CaseStudiesSection, ProcessSection, FAQSection, FinalCTASection, ProblemsSection, TargetClientsSection, TechStackSection, WhyMeSection).
- **Behavior**: Tailwind v4 prefers the shorter `text-(--app-muted)` syntax over `text-[var(--app-muted)]`. tsserver/eslint surface a `suggestCanonicalClasses` warning on every occurrence. Builds and runtime are unaffected.
- **Suggested fix**: one-shot regex sweep (`[var\(--([\w-]+)\)\]` → `(--$1)`) across the 11 files, in a single chore commit. Trivial diff but touches a lot of lines — keep it isolated from feature commits to make review tractable.
- **Why not now**: pure stylistic refactor, zero functional impact. Should not be bundled with feature commits per atomic-commit discipline.

### F14 — Wire `resources/arsenale-mentale.html` into the admin as a gated route — UNBLOCKED 2026-06-03

- **Where**: `resources/arsenale-mentale.html` — 368-line self-contained dark-themed page (36-book reading roadmap, personal "arsenale mentale" dossier, IT). Originally committed on `dev/pitch` (`4fb6a60`), cherry-picked onto `feat/admin-phase-3-plan` (`6c5e30f`). Still an orphan — zero references from any app.
- **Decision (2026-06-03)**: port into the admin surface as `apps/web-next/app/admin/arsenale/page.tsx`, gated by the existing admin auth. Admin-only — personal content, not public portfolio material. Add to the admin nav alongside leads / site-config.
- **No longer blocked**: the original deferral reason ("admin auth gate doesn't exist yet") is gone. Phase 1-2 shipped the gate — `apps/web-next/app/admin/layout.tsx` already calls `requireAdminSession()` and renders the admin shell + nav. Any new `app/admin/arsenale/page.tsx` inherits that gate automatically. The proxy already matches `/admin/:path*`.
- **Port notes**: page is raw `<html>` + inline `<style>` + Google Fonts (Fraunces / Hanken Grotesk). Per the spec's no-Tailwind-in-web-next decision it can keep its self-contained inline styles (wrap the `<body>` markup in a React component, move the `<style>` into a scoped block or `globals.css`) or be served as static content. Pure static — no DB/leads/site_config dependency. Just a gated route + a nav link.
- **Related**: extends the [F12] admin-page direction; the admin auth + shell it depends on are already merged on this branch.

### F15 — Wire Resend email (lead notifications + admin "Send test email") — DEFERRED 2026-06-08

- **Where**: `apps/web-next/lib/email.ts` (`sendTestEmail`, `sendLeadNotification`), admin Site config page.
- **Current state**: `.env.local` has `RESEND_FROM=Hassan <onboarding@resend.dev>` and a blank `RESEND_API_KEY=`. Admin "Notify email override" already set to `hassan.akkari@icloud.com` (notifications resolve to iCloud; public contact stays gmail). No API key → button reports "Resend not configured". Email path is **optional** — leads still save to the DB without it; both email fns fail gracefully (`{ok:false}`, never throw).
- **Why deferred**: not worth the email-infra detour right now; DB separation (the actual session goal) is done. Hassan is happy with leads-to-DB-only for now.
- **Next step**: full procedure in `apps/web-next/RESEND_SETUP.md`. TL;DR — sign up Resend with `hassan.akkari@icloud.com`, create API key, paste into `.env.local`, restart `pnpm dev:next`, click Send test email. For sending to arbitrary recipients / prod: verify `itshassan.it` in Resend + add DKIM/SPF/MX DNS at OVH (Resend uses a `send.` subdomain, so OVH root MX for `contact@itshassan.it` stays intact).
- **Related**: same OVH DNS console as the future `admin.itshassan.it` subdomain.

## 2026-05 audit pass — open items

> Surfaced by the parallel `apps/docs` / `apps/web-react` / `apps/web-next` / `packages/ui` / cross-cutting audit run on `chore/audit-cleanup-2026-05`. Fixed in the same branch: turbo `globalEnv`, ESLint typed lint for `packages/ui`, `framer-motion` peerDep, `/api/checkout` middleware matcher, SiteHeader `<button>`-in-`<ul>`, ContactForm `submitted` state.

### Critical — deferred to a follow-up PR (require larger refactors)

#### A1 — `apps/web-next` checkout idempotency key is regenerated on every render

- **Where**: `apps/web-next/app/checkout/page.tsx:50` (`const idempotencyKey = randomUUID()` inside the Server Component body).
- **Why it matters**: the contract that `idempotencyKey` is supposed to enforce ("same key → same order") only holds within the lifespan of a single rendered HTML page. Back-button + resubmit, or any cookie/middleware redirect that re-renders the page, produces a brand new key — so duplicate submissions create duplicate orders.
- **Suggested fix**: generate the key client-side (in a small `'use client'` form wrapper using `useRef` or `sessionStorage` keyed by `slug+date+email`), or issue it once server-side into the cookie/session and reuse it on resubmission. Pair with binding the key to the session (see A2).
- **Why deferred**: requires introducing a `'use client'` boundary for the form, which is the same surgery as A2 and A3 and should be done in one coordinated change.

#### A2 — Idempotency key in writable hidden field allows order retrieval by replay

- **Where**: `apps/web-next/app/checkout/page.tsx:87` + `apps/web-next/lib/orders.ts:86-93`.
- **Why it matters**: the key is a UUID inside a tampering-friendly hidden input. Submitting somebody else's UUID returns their full `OrderRecord` (name, email, paymentMethod). Within the MVP this is information disclosure, not just MVP-shaped weakness.
- **Suggested fix**: bind the key to the session cookie at creation time and verify the binding on lookup; or move the key into a server-set, HttpOnly cookie. Couple with A1.

#### A3 — Server Action validation failure silently redirects to `/cart`

- **Where**: `apps/web-next/app/checkout/page.tsx:66-68`.
- **Why it matters**: zod failures (tampered payloads, missing fields slipping past `required`) bounce users to cart with no message. There's no way to distinguish "validation failed" from "user changed their mind".
- **Suggested fix**: convert `submitOrder` to return a discriminated union (`{ ok: true; orderId } | { ok: false; fieldErrors }`) and consume it via `useActionState` in a `'use client'` form component. Render errors inline.
- **Why deferred**: same `'use client'` surgery as A1/A2 — bundle them.

### High priority debt

#### A4 — `apps/web-next` slug validation gap → unhandled server exceptions

- **Where**: `apps/web-next/lib/bookingSchemas.ts` (no slug-existence refinement), thrown inside `apps/web-next/lib/pricing.ts`'s `quoteBooking`.
- **Why it matters**: a crafted URL like `/cart?slug=fake&...` produces an unhandled server-side exception in the Server Component body of `cart/page.tsx:50` and `checkout/page.tsx:48`. Next.js renders the generic error page.
- **Suggested fix**: add `.refine(slug => VALID_SLUGS.includes(slug), "Unknown experience")` in `bookingSchemas.ts`; surface as `notFound()` from the page. One-file change.

#### A5 — `packages/ui/src/components/tw-ui/link.tsx` TODO unresolved

- **Where**: `packages/ui/src/components/tw-ui/link.tsx:1-7` (Catalyst boilerplate TODO; renders raw `<a>`). Consumed transitively by `button.tsx`, `dropdown.tsx`, `navbar.tsx`, `sidebar.tsx`, `pagination.tsx`, `table.tsx`.
- **Why it matters**: every `href`-based component in `packages/ui` triggers a full page reload in the React Router 7 SPAs (`apps/docs`, `apps/web-react`) and bypasses Next's `<Link>` prefetch in `apps/web-next`. A real DIP leak that no audit found before because none of those `tw-ui` components are exported by `index.ts` yet — see A6.
- **Suggested fix**: inject the link component via React context (`LinkContext` defaulting to native `<a>`); each app provides its own router-aware `Link` at the root. Document in the package README and bump `CLAUDE.md` Conventions when shipped.

#### A6 — 26+ `tw-ui` components compiled into `dist/` but never exported

- **Where**: `packages/ui/src/index.ts` exports only `Input`, `InputGroup`, `Textarea` from `tw-ui/`. The other 26 are part of `rootDir` so `tsc` emits them, but consumers can't import them.
- **Why it matters**: the intent is ambiguous. Either the components are private (Catalyst-style copy-paste) — in which case they shouldn't be in `src/` shipped to consumers — or the exports are simply missing.
- **Suggested fix**: decide the model. If private, move to `internal/` outside `src/` and stop emitting. If public, add `export * from "./components/tw-ui/<name>"` lines and add a story per component.

#### A7 — `packages/ui/src/components/tw-ui/dropdown.tsx:139` double-spread bug

- **Where**: `<div {...props} data-slot="label" className={...} {...props} />` — `{...props}` appears twice.
- **Why it matters**: trailing spread silently overwrites `data-slot` if any consumer passes `data-slot` via `props`, and double-applies all other attributes.
- **Suggested fix**: remove the trailing `{...props}`. One-line.

#### A8 — `apps/docs/src/App.tsx` god component

- **Where**: locale state + localStorage effect + 2 RTK Query calls + fallback merge + `AnimatePresence` orchestration + inline route tree, all in 145 lines.
- **Suggested fix**: extract `useLocale()` (locale + persistence) and `usePortfolioData(locale)` (queries + fallback merge). Inline routes can stay until the route count grows.

#### A9 — `apps/docs/src/state/api.ts` mixes local JSON and GitHub origins in one RTK service

- **Where**: `apps/docs/src/state/api.ts:25-29` — `baseUrl: import.meta.env.BASE_URL` + a GitHub absolute URL endpoint.
- **Why it matters**: any future middleware (auth headers, retries) added to `contentApi` will leak into GitHub requests. Different services with different origins need different `createApi` instances.
- **Suggested fix**: split into `contentApi` and `githubApi`, each with their own `baseQuery`.

#### A10 — `apps/docs` heading hierarchy broken (multiple `<h1>` per page) ✅ RESOLVED 2026-05-15

- **Was**: `AboutSection.tsx:179`, `ContactSection.tsx:77`, `PortfolioSection.tsx:45` all emitted `<h1 className="sub-title">` next to SiteHeader's `<h1>`. CvPage also had two `<h1>` (intro title + paper title with the name).
- **Fix applied**: demoted the four section/paper headings to `<h2>`. Class-based CSS unchanged for `.sub-title`; `.cv-header h1` selectors retargeted to `.cv-header h2`. Visual rendering byte-identical; single `<h1>` per page now resolves to SiteHeader (web) or cv-intro (CV view).

#### A11 — `apps/docs` no route-change focus management

- **Where**: `apps/docs/src/App.tsx` (routing shell). Navigating from `/` to `/cv` (and back) keeps focus on the activating link until `AnimatePresence` removes the source DOM node — at which point focus is lost.
- **Suggested fix**: a small `useEffect` on `location.pathname` that moves focus to the page's main heading or `<main>`.

#### A12 — `apps/web-next/tsconfig.json` and `packages/ui/tsconfig.json` missing strict-mode parity flags

- **Where**: both tsconfigs have only `strict: true`. Missing `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, `noUncheckedSideEffectImports`, `erasableSyntaxOnly` — flags `CLAUDE.md` Conventions mandates "everywhere".
- **Suggested fix**: add the five flags. Likely zero-noise on `packages/ui`; may surface unused imports/parameters in `apps/web-next` worth fixing.

### Medium / hygiene

#### A13 — `@vercel/analytics` shipped in `apps/web-react` and `apps/web-next` (both target OVH, not Vercel)

- **Where**: `apps/web-react/package.json:19` + `apps/web-react/src/main.tsx:5`; `apps/web-next/package.json:15` + `apps/web-next/app/layout.tsx:4`.
- **Why it matters**: until D1/D2 are resolved, both apps make a per-page-load outbound call to a Vercel collector that returns 404 on OVH. Wasted bytes + misleading telemetry posture.
- **Suggested fix**: gate behind `import.meta.env.VITE_VERCEL_ENV` (or the Next equivalent), or remove until the deploy decision lands.

#### A14 — MSW worker leaks into `apps/web-react/dist/`

- **Where**: `apps/web-react/public/mockServiceWorker.js` is copied into `dist/` by Vite's static-asset handling. The startup guard in `main.tsx:20` blocks it from registering in prod, but the file still ships.
- **Suggested fix**: remove from `dist/` post-build (extend the existing `postbuild` hook or replace it; see A18 — they overlap).

#### A15 — French i18n diacritics stripped throughout `apps/docs/src/i18n/messages.ts` ✅ RESOLVED (pre-2026-05-15, outdated note)

- **Was reported**: stripped diacritics across FR strings + EN/IT locale labels for French.
- **Verification 2026-05-15**: re-scanned `messages.ts` and `portfolio-content.fr.json` against the original pattern list (Francais/Ecrivez/Telecharger/Reserver/professionnel/Experience/propos/Informations supplementaires). All current diacritics are correct: `Français`, `À propos`, `Écrivez-moi`, `Télécharger`, `Réserver`, `Expérience`, `Résumé professionnel`, `Informations supplémentaires`, `cœur`, `réutilisables`, etc. Followup note was outdated.

#### A16 — `apps/docs/public/data/portfolio-content.fr.json:21` `resumePath` points to the English CV PDF ✅ RESOLVED 2026-05-15 (documented as intentional)

- **Was**: FR JSON's `resumePath` pointed at `pdf/CV-ENG-102025.pdf`; no `pdf/CV-FRA-*.pdf` exists. Behavior was correct (FR locale serves the EN PDF) but undocumented.
- **Resolution**: added an inline comment in `apps/docs/src/App.tsx:72-77` explaining the FR-falls-through-to-EN rule and that the JSON path mirrors the fallback. No code change; FR CV PDF still TODO if Hassan wants it. Note in App.tsx is the durable explanation; this followup entry can stay closed.

#### A17 — `apps/docs/src/components/sections/contactForm.schema.ts` error messages hardcoded English

- **Where**: zod schema messages always render in English regardless of locale.
- **Suggested fix**: add `formErrorNameShort` / `formErrorEmail` / `formErrorMessageShort` keys to `Messages["contact"]` and pass them into a schema factory.

#### A18 — `apps/docs` and `apps/web-react` `index.html → 404.html` postbuild copy

- **Where**: `apps/docs/package.json:8` (inline) and `apps/web-react/package.json:9-10` (postbuild hook).
- **Why it matters**: vestigial GitHub Pages SPA fallback. Vercel doesn't need it. OVH (when wired) will or won't depending on the chosen server. Leaving it in is harmless but adds noise.
- **Suggested fix**: bundle removal with A14 (MSW worker cleanup) for `web-react`. Standalone removal for `docs`. Confirm OVH topology first (D2). **Already filed as F10 — kept here as a reminder, will collapse into a single removal commit when the path is clear.**

#### A19 — `apps/web-react` orphan code: `THEME_KEY` duplicated, `@vercel/analytics`, `useAppDispatch`/`useAppSelector` exported but unused, `favicon` MIME mismatch (`type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.png"` while the file on disk is `favicon.svg`)

- **Where**: `apps/web-react/src/main.tsx:10-17` + `src/hooks/useTheme.ts:5,7-18` (THEME_KEY duplication); `apps/web-react/index.html:5` (favicon mismatch); `apps/web-react/src/store/hooks.ts:4-5` (typed wrappers with no consumers).
- **Suggested fix**: small cleanup PR. Export `THEME_KEY` + `resolveInitialTheme` from `useTheme.ts` and consume from `main.tsx`. Fix favicon to `favicon.svg`. Decide on the typed-hook wrappers (keep + add `no-restricted-imports` rule, or remove).

#### A20 — `packages/ui/src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` is the only default export in the public API

- **Where**: `ThemeToggle.tsx:5` uses `export default function`. `src/index.ts:1` re-exports it as named — masking the inconsistency.
- **Suggested fix**: convert to a named export at source. One-file rename + index update.

#### A21 — `apps/docs/tailwind.config.ts:4` uses Tailwind v3 `darkMode: ["class", ".dark"]` (dead config in v4)

- **Where**: file is loaded via `@config "../tailwind.config.ts"` in `index.css:2`, but Tailwind v4 ignores the `darkMode` key — the dark variant is correctly declared via `@custom-variant` in the CSS.
- **Suggested fix**: remove the dead key. Audit the rest of `tailwind.config.ts` for other v3-only options that became dead in v4.

#### A22 — `apps/docs` has 8 independent `useReducedMotion()` calls

- **Where**: 8 components each call `Boolean(useReducedMotion())` independently. The `Boolean(...)` wrapper is also redundant (the hook returns `boolean | null`, and `Boolean(null) === false`).
- **Suggested fix**: small `useMotion()` hook in `src/hooks/`, or pass `reduceMotion` from `App.tsx` via context. Drop the `Boolean(...)` wrapper.

### Documentation drift

#### A23 — `CLAUDE.md` Gotcha #2 cites a path alias that no longer exists in the tsconfig

- **Where**: Gotcha #2 says the dead `@laboratoire/ui` alias is in `apps/web-react/tsconfig.app.json:11-13`. The tsconfig was already cleaned; the alias survives only in `apps/web-react/vite.config.ts:28` (the Vite resolver, also unused at runtime — see F2).
- **Suggested fix**: update Gotcha #2 to point at `vite.config.ts` and merge with F2 in the next bootstrap pass.

#### A24 — `commit 1c968a3` (`feat: add @vercel/analytics across all apps`) added technical debt not tracked here

- **Why it matters**: reinforces the need to update `_followup.md` whenever a commit ships something that creates incoherence with the documented topology — see A13.
- **Suggested fix**: process note. Adopt "if this commit makes a `_followup.md` entry obsolete OR creates a new pending question, edit `_followup.md` in the same PR" as a soft rule.

#### A25 — `apps/docs/src/components/sections/ServicesSection.tsx` is dead code

- **Where**: zero imports across `apps/docs/src`. Hardcoded English strings, `<i>` used as icon container.
- **Suggested fix**: delete. If it's intended to be revived, add a `_followup.md` note and remove from the tree (`noUnusedLocals` is currently enforced at the file level only, not module-graph level).

#### A26 — `apps/docs/src/components/layout/SiteHeader.tsx:81-90` `FaBars` icon missing `aria-hidden`

- **Where**: open-menu button. The close button (FaTimes) was given `aria-hidden="true"` when its `<li>` wrapper was added in this audit pass; the open button still lacks it.
- **Suggested fix**: add `aria-hidden="true"` for parity. Trivial.

## 2026-06-25 — HeroUI P5 (web-next) migration — open items

> Surfaced during the public-funnel + admin migration of `apps/web-next` onto the shared
> `@laboratoire/ui` `App*` wrappers (branch `feat/heroui-universal-ui-system`). Funnel (7 pages)
> + admin (7 files, Variant B via orchestrator competition) are merged + green.

### H1 — `apps/web-next/next-env.d.ts` flaps between `dev` and `build` variants

- **Where**: `apps/web-next/next-env.d.ts` (tracked since `4925b17`).
- **Behavior**: Next.js auto-regenerates this file. `next dev` writes
  `import "./.next/dev/types/routes.d.ts"`; `next build` writes `import "./.next/types/routes.d.ts"`.
  Because the file is committed, switching between dev and a prod build shows it as Modified
  every time (Hassan noticed it dirty in the IDE). The file header says "should not be edited".
- **Suggested fix**: gitignore `apps/web-next/next-env.d.ts` (Next regenerates it on every build,
  so it never needs to be tracked) — OR pin it to the `build` variant and accept dev-time dirt.
  Trivial; isolate in its own chore commit. Confirm CI (`pnpm check`) still typechecks web-next
  without the tracked file (Next recreates it before `tsc`).

### H2 — admin in-app nav uses full-page anchors instead of Next `<Link>` (from the admin migration)

- **Where**: `apps/web-next/app/admin/(authed)/page.tsx` ("Clear"),
  `(authed)/leads/[id]/page.tsx` ("← Back to leads"), `not-found.tsx` (3 links). All now
  `AppButton as="a" href=…` (full-page navigation, no prefetch) where they were `next/link` before.
- **Why it matters**: client-side nav + prefetch lost on these admin links. Tolerable for a
  single-operator internal tool; flagged by the adversarial pass (MEDIUM) during the Variant-B merge.
- **Suggested fix**: give `packages/ui` a router-aware link path (the [A5] `LinkContext` idea), or
  use `<Link>` wrapped in button styling for in-app admin nav. Pairs with A5.

### H3 — redundant `aria-label` on AppInputs already inside `<label className="form-label">`

- **Where**: `apps/web-next/app/admin/login/page.tsx`, `(authed)/site-config/page.tsx` (and the
  same pattern in the migrated funnel forms — checkout/experiences). Each `AppInput` carries an
  `aria-label` while also being wrapped in a visible `<label>`; the `aria-label` overrides the
  wrapping label's implicit association (announced text is identical, so no functional impact).
- **Why it matters**: minor a11y redundancy; flagged LOW by the adversarial pass.
- **Suggested fix**: either drop the `aria-label` and rely on the wrapping `<label>` (needs the
  label associated via `htmlFor`/`id` to be correct), or pass the label text through AppInput's
  own `label` prop and drop the outer `<label>`. Decide one labelling convention for the wrappers
  and apply it consistently across web-next forms.

### H4 — `apps/web-next` admin: maximal HeroUI adoption (AppTable + AppChip) deferred

- **Where**: `(authed)/page.tsx` leads dashboard — kept native `<table className="admin-table">`
  and `.tag--*` status spans (Variant B, parity-first, won the competition).
- **Why deferred**: Variant A's AppTable+AppChip adoption was the competition runner-up — it drops
  the hand-tuned `.admin-table`/`.tag` CSS, is the first in-app use of AppTable (no visual test),
  and its AppChip color-map collapses `new`(blue)+`cal`(purple) onto one accent color. Parity won
  for the internal tool. Variant A is archived at tag `hub/archive/20260625-164205/agent-1` if the
  team later wants the full-system look (would need AppChip to gain more colors + a visual check).
- **Suggested approach**: revisit only if the admin gets a visual refresh; pair with extending
  AppChip's v3 color axis. Not urgent.

## P4 web-react migration follow-ups (2026-06-25)

### H5 — StatusCard status chips use v3-DEFAULT colors, not warm-tuned

- **Where**: `apps/web-react/src/components/sections/StatusCard.tsx` — AppChip with
  `color="success"|"warning"|"danger"|"default"` (online/offline/checking/unknown).
- **What**: `packages/ui/src/theme/v3/warmThemeV3.css` defines NO warm
  `--success`/`--warning`/`--danger` tokens, so those chips fall back to the
  `@heroui-v3/styles/themes/default` palette (green hue 150 / amber 72 / red 24).
  Fully styled + semantically distinct — just not warm-tuned. Same gap docs has;
  documented at `AppChip.tsx:32-37`. NOT introduced by P4 (flagged LOW by the
  adversarial pass).
- **Suggested fix**: add warm `--success`/`--warning`/`--danger` (+ `-soft`) tokens
  to `warmThemeV3.css` — a `packages/ui` change benefiting every app's status chips.
  Pair with a visual check. Not urgent.

### H6 — orphaned worktree dirs locked on disk (Windows)

- **Where**: `.claude/worktrees/agent-a9a74d341c61eece7`, `-ac73358334358d18c`,
  `-ae1f9dfc10b443128` (the 3 P4 competition worktrees).
- **What**: `git worktree remove` + `git worktree prune` succeeded (git metadata
  clean; `git worktree list` = main only), but the dirs can't be `rm`'d — the native
  `tailwindcss-oxide.win32-x64-msvc.node` is memory-mapped/locked by the gate's pnpm
  process. Dirs are gitignored, invisible to git — purely disk residue, NOT dirty git
  state.
- **Suggested fix**: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .claude/worktrees/agent-*` after the
  locking process exits (new shell / next session). Harmless to leave.

### C1 (CLAUDE.md drift) — gotcha #2 now doubly wrong

- **Where**: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` gotcha #2 + the architecture mermaid edge
  (`ui -.alias declared but no import.-> webreact`).
- **What**: web-react DID import `UiProvider` (RouterUiProvider.tsx) even before P4,
  and after P4 it imports the full App* set (AppButton/Card/Chip/Input/Textarea/
  Select/Checkbox/Switch) across 4 component files. The "dead alias, zero imports"
  claim is false. The mermaid `ui --> webreact` edge is now a real solid dependency.
- **Suggested fix**: `bootstrap audit` or a targeted CLAUDE.md edit — rewrite gotcha
  #2, flip the mermaid edge to solid, and update gotcha #4 (web-react index.css now
  carries the v3 coexistence block). Out of P4 commit scope.

## P6/Job2 web-next admin-primary restructure follow-ups (2026-06-26)

### J1 — admin.itshassan.it DNS + deploy still human-gated (the infra half of Job 2)

- **Where**: `apps/web-next/proxy.ts` host-route is DONE + unit-tested — when host is
  `admin.itshassan.it`, `/` rewrites to `/admin` (admin gate still applies via the
  (authed) layout's requireAdminSession()). 
- **What's left (NOT code, can't verify from repo)**: point the subdomain at the
  deployment — a CNAME on OVH + add `admin.itshassan.it` as a domain on the web-next
  Vercel project. BUT web-next has NO deploy target yet (CLAUDE.md gotcha #5), so this
  is moot until web-next is actually hosted. The proxy is ready for when it is.
- **Suggested**: when web-next gets a deploy target, (1) create the Vercel project,
  (2) add both `itshassan.it`/apex behavior + `admin.itshassan.it` domains, (3) OVH
  CNAME `admin` → Vercel. Then verify the live subdomain serves /admin at root.

### J2 — proxy host×path comment matrix under-documents /checkout rewrite (LOW)

- **Where**: `apps/web-next/proxy.ts` host-routing block + its comment matrix.
- **What**: on the admin host, the `!startsWith("/admin")` guard also rewrites
  `/checkout` + `/api/checkout` → `/admin` (subdomain is admin-only, so this is
  CORRECT behavior — booking funnel isn't served on the admin host), but the comment
  matrix only spells out `/` → /admin. The doc under-describes actual behavior.
- **Suggested fix**: add a `/checkout*` row to the matrix comment. Cosmetic; no
  behavior change. Flagged LOW by the adversarial pass.

### J3 — route-group moves poison the main checkout's .next cache (process note)

- **What**: after merging the restructure, `pnpm check` failed with stale
  `.next/dev/types/validator.ts` referencing pre-move paths (`app/cart/page.js`).
  Variant gates were green (fresh worktree `.next`); the MAIN checkout's `.next` was
  stale. `rm -rf apps/web-next/.next` fixed it.
- **Suggested**: whenever a Next route move/rename merges, clear `apps/web-next/.next`
  before trusting a local `pnpm check` in the main checkout. Not a code issue.

### Resolved this session
- **H6** (locked P4 worktree dirs): the 3 dirs were removed during the P6 cleanup once
  the locking processes exited. `.claude/worktrees/` is now empty. DONE.

## 2026-07-19 — CLAUDE.md drift — bootstrap audit needed

> Surfaced during the 2026-07-19 doc-drift pass (digital-garden real-vault sync +
> middleware→proxy line fix). Only the proxy line was corrected in CLAUDE.md; the
> items below are the drift deliberately NOT fixed surgically.

### C2 — web-next described as in-memory orders + single-cookie MVP, but `lib/db/` (Drizzle) exists

- **Where**: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — mermaid node ("Server Actions · zod · in-memory orders"),
  the `orders.ts` `globalThis.__bookingOrderStore__` note, gotcha #6 — vs.
  `apps/web-next/lib/db/client.ts` + `apps/web-next/lib/db/schema.ts` (Drizzle client + schema)
  present on disk.
- **What**: the persistence story CLAUDE.md tells for web-next is likely stale. Needs a
  verification pass (what still runs on the globalThis store vs. what moved to Drizzle/DB)
  before the description is rewritten — a larger rewrite than the 2026-07-19 surgical fix.

### C3 — CLAUDE.md architecture section missing apps/control-centre and the digital-garden pipeline

- **Where**: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` Architecture (mermaid + notes).
- **What**: no mention of `apps/control-centre` (local-only QoL dashboard, branch
  `claude/qol-control-centre-9fsas9`) nor of the digital-garden vault→site pipeline in
  `apps/docs` (`scripts/vault-sync.ts`, `/notes` routes, `notes.json` — see
  `docs/digital-garden.md`).

### Suggested action

Run the `bootstrap audit` trigger from CLAUDE.md's Re-bootstrap section — it diffs the doc
against the current repo and reports incoherence. C2/C3 (plus the still-open C1 above)
should all fall out of that pass.
